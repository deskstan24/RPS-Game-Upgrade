# RPS-Game-Upgrade

This is the Upgraded version of the RPS Game created a couple of weeks back. This game was done with the help of chatGPT to make the project move on faster. chatGPT also helped in debugger the code. I worked out some of the logic myself and told chatGPT what to do.
Overall, it was a combined effort.
Although, the game is not as perfect as I want it to be due to my limited knowledge, I'll probably revist it later in the future for uogrades.
